## Understand what problem you are trying to solve
Without understanding what you are trying to accomplish, you are just producing some lines of code, possibly you are
just wasting your time, in the end you might end up with throwing that code away and make stakeholders angry if you
don't deliver a feature, which doesn't meet requirements. First try to understand the product as clearly as possible,
create mental model in your brain, then converting them into code will be much easier.

## Get confident
Whatever you do, confidence comes first, confidence itself comes from experience, you have to always try->fail->learn
and get confident. Experience is not just doing your job, it's doing your job very well, exceptionally well, keeping
quality always in mind, that will guide through your entire career. Fear of losing your job, earning less, becoming
not successful in your life, you can add as much as you wish. Put those fears aside, think about doing what you love,
and improve your skills continuously without interruption.

## Always write test
You are lazy, or you think you have to deliver the feature before deadline, right? And this is happening every day?
If so there is clearly something wrong with the culture where you are working, there is no sense of quality, because
if you deliver a feature, and that feature is not tested against different cases, users of the product will unsatisfied,
eventually they will lose trust on the product. Or imagine you deliver new feature and it creates new bug, without
testing you are basically adding new bugs to the system unintentionally.

## Don't focus on technologies, focus on solving problems
If you focus on particular language/technology you limit your way of thinking to that particular language/technology.
Instead focus on solving problems in an elegant way, teach yourself new languages whenever you get a chance, you don't
have to write a whole project in a given language, just learning the way how different languages try to solve problem
will enlighten you. I learned to provide type checking as much as possible in dynamic languages like PHP or Python by
learning statically type language, such as Java. That changed my mindset, even if it's perfectly fine to omit type
checking for input and output data in dynamic languages, it helps to prevent potential bugs.

## You don't have to stay where you don't enjoy working
Maybe you feel alone, whenever you are talking about improving something in your environment/tooling etc. In the end
nothing is improving and you don't see any progress? No one seems to support you? Instead there is a fear of change
and "if that works, don't touch it" mentality even if you try hard to change this mindset? Then don't waste your time,
it's time to switch where people want to work together and improve things, and your words and thoughts are valuable.

## Always learn from others
Proven open-source projects are good resources to learn from, in the end they are done in a collabaration of many
professionals and battle-tested, whether you want how design/architect, or how to name variables/functions, choosing
right built-in method they will help you.

## Toxic environment fixable, if it's only about you
Believe it or not, people never changes, if you detect there are toxic people around you, don't try to fix them, in the 
end you will waste your time, if you detect, that you yourself somehow are toxic, try to fix.

## Be data driven when you try to improve something
Whatever you propose as an improvement on processes they are in most cases are just collection of words, unless you
justify or show enough data how they can help to tackle particular problem. You want to apply functional programming
for some part of the application? Great!; but what value that brings to the business, can you justify it? Maybe it
will be easier to test and maintain?
