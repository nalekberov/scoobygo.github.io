After years of pause I started to blogging again. Of course you will not find my previous blog posts here. I wrote here, here, and here in case you are interested.

I will primarily write blog posts for myself, because this way learning becomes more fun and effective. Because in order to understand deeply we sometimes have to try to teach. It helps to remember things more clearly.

Of course I won’t write here about conspiracy theories, who rules the world, who is stronger or weaker, even how long are Donald Trump’s hairs. Instead I will share about my experience, stranger bugs (BTW I’m fan of Stranger Things these days) that I’m facing.

Soo, what are you waiting for? Don’t be shy, pass by and say ‘Hi’ :). My contacts are below.
